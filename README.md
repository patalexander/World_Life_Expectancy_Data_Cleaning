# World Life Expectancy Data Cleaning in SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset containing global life expectancy data for analysis. The dataset includes life expectancy figures by country and year, along with economic indicators such as GDP. The data cleaning process ensures data consistency, removes inaccuracies, and addresses missing values to enable reliable analysis.

## Summary
### Goal
To clean and preprocess global life expectancy data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for meaningful analysis.

### Process
1. **Data Inspection:**
   - Identified inconsistencies and missing values.
   - Checked for duplicate records.
   
2. **Data Cleaning Steps:**
   - Removed or corrected invalid entries (e.g., negative values, outliers).
   - Handled missing values through imputation or deletion.
   - Standardized country names and formats.
   - Checked and corrected data types.

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Verified cleaned data against expected distributions.
   - Ensured consistency across related fields.

### Key Findings/Insights
- Some records contained missing or incorrect life expectancy values, requiring imputation or removal.
- Inconsistencies in country names and formats were standardized.
- GDP values had outliers that needed handling for accurate analysis.
- The cleaned dataset is now structured and ready for further exploratory data analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Database Management System:** SQL
- **Techniques Used:** Data validation, standardization, missing value treatment, and outlier handling.

## Conclusion
Cleaning the life expectancy dataset is a crucial step in ensuring meaningful and accurate analysis. By addressing missing values, standardizing formats, and handling outliers, the dataset is now optimized for further exploration and trend analysis.
